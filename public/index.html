      <b>Rules :</b>
      <ol>
        <li>2048 is played on a gray 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. </li>
        <li>Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. </li>
        <li>Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. </li>
        <li>If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. </li>
        <li>The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move. </li>
        <li>If a move causes three consecutive tiles of the same value to slide together, only the two tiles farthest along the direction of motion will combine. </li>
        <li>If all four spaces in a row or column are filled with tiles of the same value, a move parallel to that row/column will combine the first two and last two.</li>
        </ol>
